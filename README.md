# BaniDB API
Active work ongoing under dev branch

# Motivation & Aims
A single, universally accessible Gurbani Database for websites and applications.

BaniDB is a tested, sustainable, and collaborative effort to provide a single, universally accessible Gurbani Database for websites and applications. It is the most accurate and complete Gurbani database ever created.

Our mission is to allow others to focus on innovation and not spend time reinventing the wheel, while employing ethical licensing and open-source development practices. We want you to build something great!

# Benefits
You may be curious about the benefits of using our database. This section elaborates on several distinct key features that will convince you to go ahead and give it a go!

# Quality
With over 30,000 corrections, we've built upon the work of SikhiToTheMax II, iGurbani, Gursevak, and other databases. We've even consolidated our efforts with the iGurbani and Gursevak teams as part of our aim to maintain the most accurate Gurbani database. We'd love for others to work with us too.

This is the ONLY database that is SGPC compliant, allowing any software developed using this database to be used in Gurdwaras across the world.

# Contributions
This project welcomes contributors and contributons from invidiuals and organisations of all levels. We've determined to make it as easy as possible to contribute, and are working on ways to further improve this.

Not a programmer? You can still contribute. Not a Gurmukhi expert? You can still contribute.

Work with us and contribute via the GitHub Repo to discuss issues, add corrections, and contribute to the roadmap of the ultimate Gurbani consolidation project.


# Transparency & Accountability
All work is done with a full audit trail and requires multiple approvals before a change is published. This process is rigorous and ensures no tampering with Gurbani.

Anyone is free to join our open Slack channel, where you can chat with us, receive support, and give your feedback.

# Content
The database contains content from a variety of academic and online sources.
